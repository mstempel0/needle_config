This software is designed to streamline the process of LDR brachytherapy.
It takes in a pre-plan needle configuration as a PDF and an OR-plan configuration.
Using a linear optimization algorithm, it then finds the optimal solution
to assign pre-plan needles to OR-plan needles and gives instructions if 
any seeds or spacers need to be added.
